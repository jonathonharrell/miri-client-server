# Miri Online's Client Server

iojs version 2.4.0

### @todo
- One-way binding syntax `{{ ::title }}`, bind once and never listen for updates, yay performance!
- Remaining auth screens: Account Pages
- Start getting some of the styles in
- Server down message
- Character Select/Create state
- Add some client side validation to auth areas to prevent unneeded roundtrips to server
